Thrilled to unveil my latest project: A Comprehensive Sales Performance Dashboard for Blinkit, developed using Power BI! ðŸŒŸ

This project represents an end-to-end transformation of raw data into valuable insights that help Blink it make informed business decisions. I utilized Power BI's powerful data visualization and analytical capabilities to build a dashboard thatâ€™s easy to navigate, highly informative, and ready to drive strategic actions. Hereâ€™s what went into it:

ðŸ”§ The Process:
1. Data Cleaning & Quality Checks â€“ Ensured the data was accurate, reliable, and free from errors, preparing it for analysis.
2. Data Modeling â€“ Structured the dataset efficiently to optimize performance and enable seamless querying and reporting.
3. DAX Calculations â€“ Created dynamic measures and KPIs to deliver insightful metrics like total sales, average sales, and customer ratings.
4. Visualization & Layout Designâ€“ Carefully crafted a user-friendly dashboard that highlights key metrics and trends for actionable insights.

ðŸ“Š Key Visualizations :
- Donut Chart : Showcases sales distribution by fat content, making it easy to see which categories are driving revenue.
- Bar Chart : Displays sales by item type, helping to identify the top-selling products at a glance.
- Stacked Column Chart : Compares fat content by outlet, offering insights into how different products perform across locations.
- Line Chart: Tracks sales by outlet establishment date, revealing trends and growth patterns over time.

ðŸš€Key Insights :
- Total Sales: The dashboard highlights $1.20M in total sales, with a deep dive into top-performing categories like Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods.
- Outlet Performance: Interestingly, Tier 3 outlets lead in revenue generation, contributing $472K to overall sales.
- Sales by Fat Content: Products with regular fat content dominate the market, pulling in $776Kin sales.

ðŸ’¡ Why This Dashboard Matters:
This dashboard is designed to provide **actionable insights** across multiple business aspects:
